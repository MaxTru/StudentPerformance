## Proposed Dataset

### Description

#### Overview

We propose to use the *"Student Performance"* dataset. The dataset documents student performance in secondary education in two Portugese schools. 

The original data provides two datasets covering two distinct subjects: Mathematics (**395 observations**) and Portugese (**649 observations**). Both datasets include the exact same set of attributes (**33 attriutes**, see table below). When merging the two datasets, one will find **382 observations/students** who are present in the data and have taken both courses. (Merged based on ` "school", "sex", "age", "address", "famsize", "Pstatus", "Medu", "Fedu", "Mjob", "Fjob", "reason", "nursery", "internet"`). We are planning to run the analysis primarily on the `Portugese` dataset since it contains more observations than the `Math` dataset (649 observations vs 395 observations). If promising, we will also model the performance in the `Math` dataset and compare the `Portugese` with the `Math` model in the course of the analysis.

The main goal of this project is to predict student performance based on demographic and social features. The dataset includes a variety of predictors. Currently we are considering the following ones as most important response and predictor variables (this list might change during the analysis):

* Main response: **G3 - final grade**
* Main predictors
    * **Sex** (categorial)
    * **Age** (numeric)
    * **Family size** (categorial)
    * **Time spend with various activites** (numeric from 1 to 5; see full list of activites below)
    * **Parents' education** (numeric from 1 to 4)

### Background information

The data was collected by using school reports and questionnaries. 

The data was accessed on 2019-07-02 via [UCI Machine Learning Repository/Student Performance](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#). 

The dataset was collected by Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, GuimarÃ£es, Portugal, [http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez).

### Motivation

The main motivation for this analysis is personal: We, the project authors (Maximilian Trumpf and Rafal Tytyk), are both parents ourselves. Being confronted with the situation that our children will go to school soon, we want to give them the best environment for a good performance in school. This analysis will help us to identify the main factors affecting performance in school.

### Evidence data loaded into `R`

First, load the data.
```{r message=FALSE}
students.por = read.csv("data/student-por.csv", sep = ";")
students.mat = read.csv("data/student-mat.csv", sep = ";")
```

Then, print first values of the main response variable `G3`.
```{r}
head(students.por$G3)
```
