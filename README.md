# Prediction of student high school performance considering demographic and social features

## Goal and motivation

The main goal of this project is to build a model which is capable of predicting student performance based on demographic and social features. In order to achieve this, we will use a dataset of student performances in secondary education in two Portugese schools (see Data chapter for details and introduction to the dataset).

The dataset contains many predictors which were collected using a consistent method (surveys and school reports) in a certain context (two defined Portugese schools in 2008). Therefore, the regression model being built will not be well fit for predicting student performance in a different context and with predictors being collected even with a slightly adjusted method. However, the primary goal of the regression model is to explain the relationship of demographic and social features for student performance.

This regression model based explanation is of personal motivation for the authors of this report since they are both fathers themselves and are interested in learning how to give a supportive environment for their children (although this analysis can of course only cover a very specialized tiny part and should not be understand as an extensive study of how to support children during high school).

## Data

The dataset was collected by Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, Guimar√£es, Portugal, http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez.
